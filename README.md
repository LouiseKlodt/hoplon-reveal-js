# hoplon.reveal

A Hoplon project that let's you create slide decks/presentations with
[Reveal.js][3] with Clojure + ClojureScript.

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]
- [leiningen][2]

If you want to build your own themes, you'll also need:

- [Node.js][4]
- [Grunt][5]
- [sass][6]

## Usage

You'll probably want to have two terminals open in your project's
directory.

1. Start the auto-compiler:

```bash
$ make watch
```

2. Run a dev HTTP server:

```bash
$ make dev
```

3. Open the example side deck:

* http:localhost:9999/example-deck.html

4. Create your own slide deck, after seeing how wonderfully clean the example
   code is!

## Themeing

You can give your slide deck a feel all your own
